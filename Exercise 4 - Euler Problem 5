# it works, but it's rather slow to print a result. I think it could be optimised.
# It returns the result as 232792560

# Euler Problem 5 : using for and range to calculate the smallest positive number 
# evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20

result = None
n = 2520
# n = smallest value evenly divisible by i. we are told that 2520 is the 
# smallest value evenly disable by range (1,10), so n must be > 2520

while not result:
    n = n + 1
    for i in range(2,21):

            break

# as long as no even number results from n / i, keep adding 1 until it does   
    else:
        result = n
# as this is the first even number found, while adding 1 each time, its the lowest one
print("the result is:",result)
